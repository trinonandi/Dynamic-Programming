### 0/1 Knap Sack
----
Given weights and values of n items, put these items in a knapsack of capacity W to get the maximum total value in the knapsack. In other words, given two integer arrays val[0..n-1] and wt[0..n-1] which represent values and weights associated with n items respectively. Also given an integer W which represents knapsack capacity, find out the maximum value subset of val[] such that sum of the weights of this subset is smaller than or equal to W. You cannot break an item, either pick the complete item or donâ€™t pick it (0-1 property).
**Input:** val[] = {60, 100, 120}, wt[] = {10, 20, 30}, W = 50  
**Output:** 220

### Subset Sum Problem
---
Given a set of non-negative integers, and a value _sum_, determine if there is a subset of the given set with sum equal to given _sum_
**Input:** set[] = {3, 34, 4, 12, 5, 2}, sum = 9
**Output:** True  
There is a subset (4, 5) with sum 9.

**Input:** set[] = {3, 34, 4, 12, 5, 2}, sum = 30
**Output:** False
There is no subset that add up to 30.

### Equal Sum Partition LeetCode 416
---
Given a **non-empty** array `nums` containing **only positive integers**, find if the array can be partitioned into two subsets such that the sum of elements in both subsets is equal.
**Input:** nums = [1,5,11,5]
**Output:** true

**Input:** nums = [1,2,3,5]
**Output:** false 

### Count Subset Sum
---
Given an array **arr[]** of length **N** and an integer **X**, the task is to find the number of subsets with sum equal to **X**.
**Input:** arr[] = {1, 2, 3, 3}, X = 6  
**Output:** 3

**Input:** arr[] = {1, 1, 1, 1}, X = 1  
**Output:** 4
